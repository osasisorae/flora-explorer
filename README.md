## Inspiration

Our inspiration for FloraExplorer stems from a deep appreciation for Indonesia's remarkable biodiversity and a shared commitment to preserving its native flora. We aim to bridge the gap between technology and nature by creating a platform for users to explore, learn, and contribute to the protection of Indonesia's native plant species.

## What It Does

FloraExplorer provides a unique platform for users to discover, learn, and engage with Indonesia's native flora. Features include the exploration of plant species, educational content, image uploads, and plant recognition.

## How It's Built

We've built FloraExplorer by integrating advanced technology and collaboration. Our chatbot is powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation technology and is connected to Telegram. We're actively working on integrating the ArcGIS API for Python to enhance image capture and geolocation storage.

## Challenges

One of the ongoing challenges we're facing is the integration of the ArcGIS API for Python, ensuring a seamless experience for image capture, plant recognition, and geolocation storage.

## Accomplishments

Our notable accomplishment is the deployment of a powerful educational chatbot, powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation technology, making it accessible to users through Telegram.

## What We Learned

Through this journey, we've learned the immense potential of technology in promoting environmental awareness and conservation. Challenges have taught us the value of persistence, adaptation, and the continuous pursuit of improvement.

## What's Next

We're committed to enhancing FloraExplorer by strengthening the collaborative features, particularly the integration of the ArcGIS API for Python. This will allow for improved image capture, plant recognition, and precise geolocation storage. Join us as we continue to explore, learn, and protect together.

## StoryMaps

We've created a StoryMap that visually tells the story of our project. [Access the FloraExplorer StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/405968b00529420289dbdc554d9eca21).
